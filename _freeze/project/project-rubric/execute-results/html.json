Are the specific questions this analysis will address clearly stated and explained? | 4 | |\n| Is relevant literature described and properly cited? Is the connection between the literature and this work made clear? | 4 | |\n| **Methods – 33 pts** | | |\n| Is the data source described and referenced? | 3 | |\n| Is each variable used in the analysis defined, including:<br>    -    descriptions of the levels for categorical variables<br>     -    units for numerical variables | 6 | |\n| Are data preparation and cleaning procedures clearly described so that the study could be replicated by another researcher?<br> Is the handling of missing data/unusual observations/outliers described and is there sound rationale for it?<br> Is the initial and final number of observations in the analysis reported and are those that were removed accounted for? | 4 | |\n| If necessary, were interactions and data transformations explored? Were these included in the model when appropriate? Were the conditions of the model checked, and were they met? | 10 | |\n| Was thoughtful variable selection employed to decide upon the final model? Was the final model compared with simpler options, and the form of the final model justified? | 10 | |\n| **Results – 20 pts** | | |\n| Are descriptive statistics provided for key variables? Are they presented in a tabular form that is concise and informative? | 5 | |\n| Are results of modeling reported in appropriate tabular form with parameter estimates, standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals? | 5 | |\n| Are parameter estimates and CIs correctly interpreted in the context of the research question? | 5 | |\n| How well are graphics/figures/equations presented? (axes labeled, captions, placement, readable, useful, add to content) | 5 | |\n| **Discussion – 21 pts** | | |\n| Does the discussion begin with an accurate summary statement of the major findings of the analysis? Are $R^2$ or misclassification rate reported (either here or in the Results)? | 4 | |\n| Are the possible implications of the results discussed in the context of the research question? | 3 | |\n|Is there a thoughtful discussion of generalizability of the results?  Are limitations of the study identified and is the potential impact on the conclusions stated? | 4 | |\n|Are strengths and weaknesses of the analysis identified, including a discussion of model conditions? | 4 | |\n|Are potential confounding variables discussed? | 3 | |\n|Are suggestions for future research identified and useful? | 3 | |\n| **Overall – Report – 18 pts** | | |\n|Were research question(s) complex and insightful, demonstrating understanding of the research topic? | 6 | |\n|How well does the author demonstrate an understanding of the statistics? Are statements and conclusions accurate? | 6 | |\n|How well-written is the report (e.g., correct grammar, spelling, etc.)? | 6 | |\n| **(Tentative) Total** | 100 | |\n| **Supporting Materials (points to be deleted)** |  | |\n| Bibliography included; citations are stylistically consistent. | -3 | |\n| Title and author appropriately identified<br> Paper follows formatting guidelines (1.5 spacing, 8 page max, etc.) | -5 | |\n| **Grant Total** |  | |\n",
