The data were originally obtained from Spotify using the **spotifyr** R package.\n\nIt contains numerous characteristics for each song. You can see the full list of variables and definitions [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md). This analysis will focus specifically on the following variables:\n\n| variable | class | description |\n|:--------------|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------|\n| track_id | character | Song unique ID |\n| track_name | character | Song Name |\n| track_artist | character | Song Artist |\n| track_popularity | double | Song Popularity (0-100) where higher is better |\n| danceability | double | Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. |\n| energy | double | Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. |\n| loudness | double | The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db. |\n| valence | double | A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). |\n| tempo | double | The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. |\n| duration_ms | double | Duration of song in milliseconds |\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspotify <- read_csv(\"../data/spotify-popular.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhat makes a song danceable? To answer this question, we'll analyze data on some of the most popular songs on Spotify, i.e. those with `track_popularity >= 80`. We'll use linear regression to fit some models to predict a song's `dancebility`. Each group will be assigned a different predictor variable.\n\n### Predictor Assignment:\n\nBelow is your assigned predictor. Look at the table above for a definition.\n\n-   **Group 1:** `energy`\n-   **Group 2:** `loudness`\n-   **Group 3:** `valence`\n-   **Group 4:** `tempo`\n\n## Exercise 0\n\nBelow are plots as part of the exploratory data analysis. Change `duration_ms` and the axis labels to match your explanatory variable.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 <- gf_histogram(~duration_ms, data = spotify) |>  \n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Song Duration\", \n       subtitle = \" for Popular songs on Spotify\", \n       x = \"Duration (ms)\")\n\np2 <- gf_histogram(~danceability, data = spotify) |> \n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Danceability\", \n       subtitle = \"for Popular songs on Spotify\", \n       x = \"Danceability\")\np1 + p2 # The patchwork package will arrange your plots for you\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-04-math-models_files/figure-html/univariate-eda-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngf_point(danceability ~ duration_ms, data = spotify) |> \n  gf_labs(title = \"Danceability vs. Duration\", \n       subtitle = \"Popular songs on Spotify\", \n       x = \"Duration (ms)\", \n       y = \"Danceability\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-04-math-models_files/figure-html/bivariate-eda-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nFit a model using your assigned explanatory variable to predict a songs `danceability`. Use `tidy` and `kable` to neatly display your model and have your reporter write you model on the white board. Be prepared to verbally interpret the slope.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## add code\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nWrite down the the null and alternative hypotheses to test whether your explanatory variable is a useful predictor.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nIdentify the standard error of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and your T-statistic from the output above. Interpret your test statistic. Do you think this provides evidence that your explanatory variable is a useful predictor of `danceability`?\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nIdentify and interpret the p-value in the output from Exercise 1. On the white board, draw a sketch of your p-value.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nBased on your p-value, how strong is the evidence that your assigned explanatory variable is a useful predictor of `danceability`?\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nWrite a conclusion for your test in the context of the problem.\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nUse `tidy` to compute a (95 - your group number)% confidence interval for your slope.\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nOn the white board, draw a picture representing the critical value for you confidence interval.\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nInterpret your confidence interval in the context of the problem.\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nPredict the average danceability for a song with:\n\n-   an energy score of 0.859\n-   a loudness score of -5.03\n-   a valence of 0.52\n-   a tempo of 125\n\nReport and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the average danceability. Have your reporter write you interval and estimate on the board.\n\n## Exercise 11\n\nReport and interpret a 90% confidence interval for a single song with:\n\n-   an energy score of 0.859\n-   a loudness score of -5.03\n-   a valence of 0.52\n-   a tempo of 125\n\n## Exercise 12\n\nWould you expect you interval to get wider or narrower if you were making a prediction for all songs with the above characteristics?\n\n::: callout-important\nTo submit the AE:\n\n-   Render the document to produce the HTML file with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Upload your QMD and HTML files to the Canvas assignment.\n:::\n",
