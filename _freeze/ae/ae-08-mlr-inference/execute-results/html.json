The PVPC collected data for ninety days from April 5, 2005 to November 15, 2005. Data collectors set up a laser sensor, with breaks in the laser beam recording when a rail-trail user passed the data collection station. More information can be found [here](http://www.fvgreenway.org), [here](https://www.trafx.net/), and [here](https://fchtrail.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FVTC-Trail-Usage-Study-2013-15.pdf).\n\n**Response**\n\n-   `volume`: Number bikes that broke the laser beam\n\n## Analysis goal\n\nThe goals of this activity are to:\n\n-   Perform inference for multiple linear regression\n-   Conduct/interpret hypothesis tests\n-   Construct/interpret confidence intervals\n-   Determine whether the conditions for inference are satisfied in this multi-predictor setting.\n\n\n## Exercise 0\n\nImport `GGally` and use `ggpairs` to plot all combinations of variables.\n\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nChoose two explanatory variables which you think will best predict `Volume` based on the plot above. Write your two variables on the board. You may not use the same combination as another group. If you choose a temperature, only select one.\n\n## Exercise 2 \n\nFit and display two linear regression models predicting `volume` from the two predictors you chose. In one, include an interaction term between the two variables and in the other, do not.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nConsider the model *without* an interaction term. Perform a hypothesis test on one of your explanatory variables (fill in the blanks where appropriate:\n\n1.  **Set hypothesis:** $H_0: \\beta_{fill in} [fill in]$ vs. $\\beta_{fill in} [fill in]$. Restate these hypothesis in words: \\[fill in\\]\n2.  **Calculate test statistics and p-value:** The test statistic is $[fill in]$. The p-value is $[fill in]$.\n3.  **State the conclusion:** \\[fill in\\]\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nConsider the model *with* an interaction term. Interpret the the p-value associated with the interaction term.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nGenerate 95% confidence intervals for the model *without* an interaction term. Hint: use the `tidy` function with the argument `conf.int = TRUE`. Interpret the confidence interval for the same explanatory variable as Exercise 3 and explain why the combination of p-value and confidence interval makes sense.\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nWhat does it mean for two things to be **independent** in statistics (feel free to use Google)? Do we think our p-values/confidence intervals are **independent** across variables?\n\n## Exercise 7\n\n::: callout-important\nIf the intercept term was significant, use that model for the rest of this activity, otherwise use the model without the interaction term. \n:::\n\nGenerate a scatter plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values for this model.\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nPlot the residuals vs. each of your predictors (two plots total).\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nBased on the three plots you've made, do you think the linearity condition is satisfied?\n\n## Exerise 10\n\nWe check the constant variance assumption in the same way we do with SLR. To what extent does the constant variance condition seem to be satisfied?\n\n## Exercise 11\n\nGenerate a histogram and QQ-plot of the residuals. To what extent do you believe the normality condition is satisfied?\n\n## Exercise 12\n\nHow do you think would you go about checking the independence condition?\n\n\n## To submit the AE\n\n::: callout-important\n-   Render the document to produce the HTML file with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Upload your QMD and HTML files to the Canvas assignment.\n:::\n",
