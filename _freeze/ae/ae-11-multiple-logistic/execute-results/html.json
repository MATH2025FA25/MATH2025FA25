We want to predict if a randomly selected adult is high risk for heart disease in the next 10 years.\n\n### Response variable\n\n-   `TenYearCHD`:\n    -   1: Patient developed heart disease within 10 years of exam\n    -   0: Patient did not develop heart disease within 10 years of exam\n\n### What are my predictor variables?\n\nBased on your group, use the following as your predictor variables.\n\n-   Group 1:\n    -   `BMI`: patient's body mass index\n    -   `diabetes`: 1 if patient has diabetes, 0 otherwise\n-   Group 2:\n    -   `cigsPerDay`: number of cigarettes patient smokes per day\n    -   `currentSmoker`: 1 if current smoker, 0 otherwise\n-   Group 3:\n    -   `sysBP`: systolic blood pressure (mmHg)\n    -   `BPMeds`: 1 if they are on blood pressure medication, 0 otherwise\n-   Group 4:\n    -   `totChol`: total cholesterol (mg/dL)\n    -   `prevalentHyp`: 1 if patient was hypertensive, 0 otherwise\n\n## Exercise 0\n\nEdit the code below to drop any missing values, convert the categorical predictors into factors, and select only the eight variables listed above along with `TenYearCHD`. Make sure to do those thing in an order that makes sense:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheart_disease <- read_csv(\"../data/framingham.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 4240 Columns: 16\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (16): male, age, education, currentSmoker, cigsPerDay, BPMeds, prevalent...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nFit a logistic regression model predicting `TenYearCHD` using your two assigned predictors. Write your resulting model on the board in any format you choose.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nFor both of your coefficients complete the madlibs below interpreting the value, you may need to edit a bit to make the final sentence grammatically correct:\n\nQuantitative variable: When \\[variable name\\] increases by \\[number\\], the typical \\[increase/decrease\\] in \\[quantity\\] is \\[number\\], \\[qualifying statement that makes this different than when we have one predictor\\].\n\nQuantitative variable: When \\[variable name\\] increases by \\[number\\], the typical odds-ratio is multiplied by a factor of \\[number\\], \\[qualifying statement that makes this different than when we have one predictor\\].\n\nCategorical variable: For patients who are \\[insert category\\] at the time of examination, the typical \\[increase/decrease\\] in \\[quantity\\] is \\[number\\] vs patients \\[insert opposite category\\], \\[qualifying statement that makes this different than when we have one predictor\\].\n\nCategorical variable: For patients who are \\[insert category\\] at the time of examination, the odds-ratio typically \\[increases/decreases\\] by a factor of \\[number\\] vs patients \\[insert opposite category\\], \\[qualifying statement that makes this different than when we have one predictor\\].\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nCompute p-values for both of your coefficients using `tidy`.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nFor both of your coefficients write the null and alternative hypotheses (in both symbols and words), the test statistics, and the p-values on the board (just pick them out from the `tidy` output). Then, complete the madlibs below interpreting the p-values, you may need to edit the final statements to make them grammatically correct:\n\nQuantitative variable: The \\[quantity\\] is \\[size\\], so we \\[do something to\\] $H_0$. The data \\[do/do not\\] provide sufficient evidence that \\[variable name\\] is a statistically significant predictor of \\[variable\\], \\[qualifying statement that makes this different than when we have one predictor\\].\n\nCategorical variable: The \\[quantity\\] is \\[size\\], so we \\[do something to\\] $H_0$. The data \\[do/do not\\] provide sufficient evidence that \\[variable name\\] is a statistically significant predictor of \\[variable\\], \\[qualifying statement that makes this different than when we have one predictor\\].\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nUse `tidy` to compute 99% confidence intervals for both of your coefficients. Write them on the board.\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nInterpret the the confidence intervals below:\n\n**Log-odds interpretation (Quantitative):**\n\n**Odds-ratio interpretation (Quantitative):**\n\n**Log-odds interpretation (Categorical):**\n\n**Odds-ratio interpretation (Categorical):**\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-important\nTo submit the AE:\n\n-   Render the document to produce the HTML file with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Upload your QMD and HTML files to the Canvas assignment.\n:::\n",
