I'm sure you've heard the phrase \"the numbers are the numbers\" or \"you can't argue with the numbers\". More often than not, this is **BULLSHIT**. Most data analyses involve making decision which are subjective. The interpretability of any form of statistical inference is heavily influenced by whether the assumptions and conditions of that inference is met, which they almost never are. It is up to the practitioner to determine whether those conditions are met and what impact those conditions have on the results of those analyses. In my work, I rarely encounter practitioners who even know what the conditions are, let alone understand why they are important. **FURTHERMORE!!!** the quality of your analysis is only as good as the quality of your data. Remember a crap study design will yield crap data which will yield crappy analysis. Statistical analyses yield one important form of evidence which should be combined with other forms of evidence when making an argument.\n\n## Linearity\n\n-   If the linear model, $\\hat{Y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1X$, adequately describes the relationship between $X$ and $Y$, then the residuals should reflect random (chance) error\n\n-   To assess this, we can look at a plot of the residuals ($e_i$'s) vs. the fitted values ($\\hat{y}_i$'s) or predictors(or $x_i$'s)\n\n-   There should be no distinguishable pattern in the residuals plot, i.e. the residuals should be randomly scattered\n\n-   A non-random pattern (e.g. a parabola) suggests a linear model that does not adequately describe the relationship between $X$ and $Y$\n\n## Linearity\n\n✅ The residuals vs. fitted values plot should show a random scatter of residuals (no distinguishable pattern or structure)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-slr-conditions_files/figure-revealjs/res-vs-fit-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The augment function {.smaller}\n\n`augment` is from the `broom` package:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspotify_aug <- augment(spotify_fit)\n\nhead(spotify_aug) |> kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| danceability| duration_min|   .fitted|     .resid|      .hat|    .sigma|   .cooksd| .std.resid|\n|------------:|------------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|\n|        0.733|     2.464000| 0.7212126|  0.0117874| 0.0057228| 0.1304132| 0.0000237|  0.0907334|\n|        0.630|     3.258650| 0.7019569| -0.0719569| 0.0021749| 0.1303749| 0.0003332| -0.5529036|\n|        0.877|     3.864133| 0.6872849|  0.1897151| 0.0024253| 0.1301401| 0.0025838|  1.4579193|\n|        0.831|     3.674783| 0.6918732|  0.1391268| 0.0020725| 0.1302669| 0.0011866|  1.0689702|\n|        0.668|     2.650183| 0.7167011| -0.0487011| 0.0044968| 0.1303962| 0.0003170| -0.3746465|\n|        0.626|     3.377017| 0.6990886| -0.0730886| 0.0020230| 0.1303736| 0.0003196| -0.5615572|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Residuals vs. fitted values (code)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspotify_aug <- augment(spotify_fit)\n\ngf_point(.resid ~ .fitted, data = spotify_aug) |>\n  gf_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") |>\n  gf_labs(\n    x = \"Fitted value\", y = \"Residual\",\n    title = \"Residuals vs. fitted values\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Non-linear relationships\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-slr-conditions_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-slr-conditions_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Violations of Linearity\n\n- Impact: inference relies on estimates of $\\sigma_\\epsilon$ computed from residuals:\n  + Residuals will be larger in certain places so estimates will be inaccurate\n  + Therefore, inference (i.e. CIs and p-values) will be inaccurate\n  + Most importantly... your predictions will be wrong most of the time\n- Remedy: transform your data (to come)\n\n. . .\n\nComplete Exercises 1-3\n\n## Constant variance {.midi}\n\n-   If the spread of the distribution of $Y$ is equal for all values of $X$ then the spread of the residuals should be approximately equal for each value of $X$\n\n-   To assess this, we can look at a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values\n\n-   The vertical spread of the residuals should be approximately equal as you move from left to right\n\n-   **CAREFUL**: Inconsistent distribution of $X$s can make it seem as if there is non-constant variance\n\n## Constant variance\n\n✅ The vertical spread of the residuals is relatively constant across the plot\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-slr-conditions_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Non-constant variance: Fan-Pattern {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-slr-conditions_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-slr-conditions_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n- Constant variance is frequently violated when the error/variance is proportional to the response variable\n- Whose wealth fluctuates more per day...
