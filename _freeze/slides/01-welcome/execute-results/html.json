It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when ***the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')***. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.\"\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) (previous definition)\n:::\n\nNote:  I don't really like the terms \"independent\" and \"dependent\" variables\n\n\n## Examples of regression in practice\n\n-   [New Yorkers Will Pay \\$56 A Month To Trim A Minute Off Their Commute](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-will-pay-56-a-month-to-trim-a-minute-off-their-commute/)\n\n-   [How FiveThirtyEight's 2020 Presidential Forecast Works --- And What's Different Because Of COVID-19](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/)\n\n-   [Effect of Forensic Evidence on Criminal Justice Case Processing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12020)\n\n-   [Why it's so freaking hard to make a good COVID-19 model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/) (from March 2020)\n\n# MAT 212\n\n## Course FAQ {.smaller}\n\n**Q - What background is assumed for the course?**\n\nA - Introductory statistics or previous experience with mathematics at a level that would allow you to learn intro stats concepts relatively easily\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Will we be doing computing?**\n\nA - Yes. We will use the computing language R for analysis and Quarto for writing up results.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Am I expected to have experience using any of these tools?**\n\nA - No. I do not expect you to have any exposure to R and certainly not Quarto.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Will we learn the mathematical theory of regression?**\n\nA - Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of simple linear regression.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - How much time should I be spending on this class?**\n\nA - This is a 3-credit class taught over 15 days which meets for 2.5 hours per day. That means that you should be spending approximately 9 hours *per day* working on this course (i.e. 6.5 hours outside of class)\n\n## Course learning objectives {.midi}\n\nBy the end of the semester, you will be able to...\n\n-   analyze real-world data to answer questions about multivariable relationships.\n-   use R to fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.\n-   assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.\n-   use Quarto to write reproducible reports.\n-   effectively communicate statistical results through writing and oral presentations.\n\n## Course Topics\n\n:::{.question}\nWhat is a quantitative and what is a categorical variable?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n|**Chapter** | **Response** | **Predictor/Explanatory** |\n|:------------:|--------------|------------------|\n|1-2      | Quantitative | Single Quantitative|\n|3-4      | Quantitative | Multiple Quantitative|\n|5      | Quantitative | Single Categorical|\n|6-8      | Quantitative | Multiple Categorical|\n|9     | Categorical | Single Quant/Cat|\n|10     | Categorical | Multiple Quant/Cat|\n|11     | Both | Both|\n\n\n# Course overview\n\n## Course toolkit {.midi}\n\n-   **Course website**: [mat212wi25.netlify.app](https://mat212wi25.netlify.app/)\n    -   Central hub for the course!\n    -   **Tour of the website**\n-   **Canvas**: [cofi.instructure.com](https://cofi.instructure.com/)\n    -   Gradebook\n    -   Assignment submissions\n    -   Announcements\n-   [**Teams**](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3AvBRIeFRpxyUJfvl-0Ur9bQWxhR_Wzkpr6iM6V_OBVKA1%40thread.tacv2/?groupId=ffcfc61b-032c-4fe3-883b-fe9fd969ea51)\n    -   Activities\n    -   Discussions\n    -   Homework Help\n\n\n## Computing toolkit\n\n::: {.fragment fragment-index=\"1\"}\n![](images/01/rstudio.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio logo\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"5.61in\" height=\"1.6in\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment fragment-index=\"2\"}\n-   All analyses using R, a statistical programming language\n\n-   Write reproducible reports in Quarto\n\n-   Access RStudio through [College of Idaho posit Workbench](https://rstudio.collegeofidaho.edu/)\n  \n    +     Use your College of Idaho email and password\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment fragment-index=\"3\"}\n-   Sign into RStudio!\n  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_e3fca70b\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">03</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">00</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n# Activities + assessments\n\n## Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform\n\n::: small\n::: incremental\n-   **Prepare:** Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by completing the readings (and sometimes watching videos)\n\n-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures, office hours, team meetings\n\n-   **Practice:** Practice applying statistical concepts and computing with application exercises during lecture, graded for completion\n\n-   **Perform:** Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data\n\n    -   Homework assignments (individual)\n\n    -   Two oral exams\n\n    -   Final group projects\n:::\n:::\n\n## Grading {.smaller}\n\n<center>\n\n| Category              | Percentage |\n|-----------------------|------------|\n| Homework              | 25%        |\n| Final Project         | 25%        |\n| Exam 01               | 20%        |\n| Exam 02               | 20%        |\n| Application Exercises | 10%        |\n\n*Note: You must receive at least a 60% on your two exams to pass the course.*\n\nSee the [syllabus](https://mat212wi25.netlify.app/syllabus) for details on how the final letter grade will be calculated.\n\n## Support\n\n-   Attend office hours to meet with Prof. Friedlander (Boone 126B)\n    -   MTWRF : 11:00am-12:00pm\n-   Ask and answer questions on course discussion forum\n-   Use email for questions regarding personal matters and/or grades\n-   See the [Course Support](https://mat212wi25.netlify.app/support) page for more details\n\n# Course policies\n\n## Late Homework\n\n-   There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late for the first two days. After 2 days, students will receive a 30% reduction. No homework will be accepted after it is returned to the class.\n\n## Late Application Exercises\n\nAEs are due the day after the class they are assigned. No late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed as in-class activities to help you prepare for homework. \n\n## School-Sponsored Events\n\nIf an application exercise or project must be missed due to a school-sponsored event, you must let me know at least a week ahead of time so that we can schedule a time for you to make up the work before you leave. If you must miss a exam or a project presentation due to illness, you must let me know before class that day so that we can schedule a time for you to make it up. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in a 35% penalty on the corresponding assignment.  \n\n## Academic integrity {.smaller}\n\n> The College of Idaho maintains that academic honesty and integrity are essential values in the educational process. Operating under an Honor Code philosophy, the College expects conduct rooted in honesty, integrity, and understanding, allowing members of a diverse student body to live together and interact and learn from one another in ways that protect both personal freedom and community standards. Violations of academic honesty are addressed primarily by the instructor and may be referred to the [Student Judicial Board](https://collegeofidaho.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Undergraduate-Catalog/Policies-and-Procedures/Academic-Misconduct).\n\nBy participating in this course, you are agreeing that all your work and conduct will be in accordance with the College of Idaho Honor Code.\n\n## Collaboration & sharing code\n\n-   I have policies! \n\n-   Let's read about them in the [Academic honesty](/syllabus.qmd#academic-honesty) section of the syllabus\n\n## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}\n\n-   You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources.\n-   There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:[^1]\n    -   \\(1\\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate---rather than hinder---learning.\n    -   \\(2\\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n[^1]: These guiding principles are based on [*Course Policies related to ChatGPT and other AI Tools*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WpCeTyiWCPQ9MNCsFeKMDQLSTsg1oKfNIH6MzoSFXqQ/preview) developed by Joel Gladd, Ph.D.[↩︎](https://sta101-f23.github.io/course-syllabus.html#fnref1)\n\n## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}\n\n✅ **AI tools for code:** You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments or to fix bugs in your code. However, if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code and AI should serve as a learning aid, not a replacement for thinking.\n\n❌ **No AI tools for narrative:** Unless instructed otherwise, AI is [**not**]{.underline} permitted for writing narrative on assignments.\n\n::: callout-important\nIn general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. **Any code or content from your homework which was not covered in class or cited, is eligible to be on your exams.**\n:::\n\n\n\n# Having a successful semester in MAT 212\n\n## Five tips for success\n\n1.  Complete all the preparation work (readings and videos) before class.\n\n2.  Ask questions.\n\n3.  Start your work (homework and projects) early!\n\n4.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a day pass by with lingering questions.\n\n5.  Stay up-to-date on announcements on Canvas and sent via email.\n\n## What should I know about this class\n\n-   This class is a lot of work\n\n-   Steep learning curve in the beginning... stick with it! I promise you can do it!\n\n-   More writing than you probably expected... it is not enough for Dr. F to know what you mean to say... you must say that! Dr F. always asks: \"If this student said this in a job interview, would they get hired?\"\n\n-   In statistics, there is rarely one RIGHT answer... it's all about extracting information from data to make arguments\n\n## Dr. F's Pet Peeves\n\n-   Showing up late to class\n\n-   Using Generative AI to do your thinking for you\n\n## Bug Bounty\n\n-   If you find a typo on the website, slides, homework, activities, etc (e.g. broken link, typo, etc...) and you are the first person to point it out, you will receive a bonus point toward your HW grade. However, you may not exceed 100%.\n\n-   If you message me about this during class, you will not receive your extra credit.\n\n# Questions?\n\nRaise your hand or post on Teams\n\n# The Big Picture\n\n## Topics\n\n-   Data analysis life cycle\n-   Reproducible data analysis\n\n##\n\n![](images/01/data-analysis-life-cycle.png)\n\nSource: [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) with additions from *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data*.\n\n##\n\n![](images/01/whole-game.png)\n\nSource: [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)\n\n\n# Reproducibility\n\n## Reproducibility checklist\n\n::: question\nWhat does it mean for an analysis to be reproducible?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Near term goals**:\n\n✔️ Can the tables and figures be exactly reproduced from the code and data?\n\n✔️ Does the code actually do what you think it does?\n\n✔️ In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?\n\n. . .\n\n**Long term goals**:\n\n✔️ Can the code be used for other data?\n\n✔️ Can you extend the code to do other things?\n\n## Why is reproducibility important?\n\n-   Results produced are more reliable and trustworthy [@ostblom2022]\n\n-   Facilitates more effective collaboration [@ostblom2022]\n\n-   Contributing to science, which builds and organizes knowledge in terms of testable hypotheses [@alexander2023]\n\n-   Possible to identify and correct errors or biases in the analysis process [@alexander2023]\n\n## When things go wrong {.smallest}\n\n| Reproducibility error                                    | Consequence                                          | Source(s)                                                                                                       |\n|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Limitations in Excel data formats                        | Loss of 16,000 COVID case records in the UK          | ([Kelion 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988))                                                   |\n| Automatic formatting in Excel                            | Important genes disregarded in scientific studies    | ([Ziemann, Eren, and El-Osta 2016](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7)) |\n| Deletion of a cell caused rows to shift                  | Mix-up of which patient group received the treatment | ([Wallensteen et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27373757/))                                          |\n| Using binary instead of explanatory labels               | Mix-up of the intervention with the control group    | ([Aboumatar and Wise 2019](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2752474))                          |\n| Using the same notation for missing data and zero values | Paper retraction                                     | ([Whitehouse et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03656-3))                                  |\n| Incorrectly copying data in a spreadsheet                | Delay in the opening of a hospital                   | ([Picken 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-53893101))                              |\n\nSource: @ostblom2022\n\n## Toolkit\n\n-   **Scriptability** $\\rightarrow$ R\n\n-   **Literate programming** (code, narrative, output in one place) $\\rightarrow$ Quarto\n\n-   **Version control** $\\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub (Beyond the scope of this course)\n\n\n## R and RStudio\n\n-   R is a statistical programming language\n\n-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)\n\n![Source: [Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html)](images/01/r_vs_rstudio_1.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## RStudio IDE\n\n![](images/01/rstudio-panes.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Quarto\n\n-   Fully reproducible reports -- the analysis is run from the beginning each time you render\n\n-   Code goes in chunks and narrative goes outside of chunks\n\n-   Visual editor to make document editing experience similar to a word processor (Google docs, Word, Pages, etc.)\n\n## Quarto\n\n![](images/01/quarto.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## How will we use Quarto?\n\n-   Every application exercise and assignment is written in a Quarto document\n\n-   You'll have a template Quarto document to start with\n\n-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester\n\n# Our first AE!\n\n## Group Work Roles {.smaller}\n\nAny time we are working on AEs, I will randomly assign you to groups of two/three.
