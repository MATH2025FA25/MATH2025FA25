It is the same data set that we used in AE-08. The data was originally generated by the American Medical Association and concerns the availability of health care in counties in the United States. You can find information [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Stat2Data/Stat2Data.pdf) by searching for the County Health Resources dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"CountyHealth\") # Loads the data from the package\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is relatively easy to count the number of hospitals a county has, whereas counting the number of doctors is much more difficult. We'd like to build a linear model to predict the number of doctors, contained in the variable `MDs`, from the number of hospitals, `Hospitals` and the number of beds, `Beds`.\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nDescribe was an observational unit represents for this data set. How many are there?\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nIn Example 1.7 of Stat2, they consider a simple linear model to predict the number of doctors (`MDs`) from the number of hospitals (`Hospitals`) in a metropolitan area. In that example, they found that a square root transformation on the response variable produced a more linear relationship. Create a new variable in the `CountyHealth` data frame called `sqrtMDs`. Hint: use the `sqrt` function inside the `mutate` function.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nUse the function `ggpairs` from the package ``GGally`` to generate a grid scatter plots and correlations. Note that you will need to select the variables you want to use. Which explanatory variable (`Hospitals` or `Beds`) has the highest correlation with `SqrtMDs`?  Is this consistent with your visual assessment?\n\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nFit a simple linear model using `SqrtMDs` as the response variable and `Hospitals` as the predictor. You may use `sqrt(MDs)` in your `lm` call instead of `SqrtMDs` if you like. How much of the variability in the `SqrtMDs` values is explained by `Hospitals`? How much of the variability in `MDs` is explained by the model you just fit. To figure this out:\n\n1. Augment your model.\n2. Convert the fitted and observed response variables back to number of MDs rather than square-root of the number of MDs.\n3. Compute the $R^2$.\n\nWhy are these two numbers different?\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nDo you think taking the square root of `Beds` would improve this model? Support your argument with plots and/or numbers.\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nRepeat exercise 4 above with `Beds` as the predictor instead of `Hospitals`.\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nFor the model you just fit, are there any high-influence outliers? Justify your answer using something from the lecture on outliers. There appear to be at least two high-leverage points. Which observations are these?\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nFit a multiple linear model using `SqrtMDs` are the response variable and both `Hospitals` and `Beds` as the predictors. Interpret both slopes and the intercept in the context of the problem.\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nHow much of the variation in `MDs` is explained by the model you just fit? Which model would you say is the \"best\", given what we've learned through the first lecture on multiple linear regression.\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nUsing the \"best\" model, predict the average number of doctors in a metro area with 1,000 beds and 4 hospitals. Report a 95% prediction interval and interpret your results in context.\n\n\n## Grading\n\nTotal points available: 50 points.\n\n| Component             | Points |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Ex 1                  | 3      |\n| Ex 2                  | 3      |\n| Ex 3                  | 5      |\n| Ex 4                  | 8      |\n| Ex 5                  | 4      |\n| Ex 6                  | 3      |\n| Ex 7                  | 5      |\n| Ex 8                  | 6      |\n| Ex 9                  | 4      |\n| Ex 10                 | 4      |\n| Workflow & formatting | 5[^1]  |\n\n[^1]: The \"Workflow & formatting\" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow, clarity, and professionalism.\n",
