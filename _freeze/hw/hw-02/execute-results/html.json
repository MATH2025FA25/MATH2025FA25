These data were originally collected in the 2019 [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) (ACS), an annual survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau that collects demographics and other information from a sample of households in the United States. The data in `county_2019` are county-level statistics from the ACS.\n\nThe primary variables you will use are the following:\n\n-   `bachelors`: Percent of population 25 years old and older that earned a Bachelor's degree or higher\n-   `median_household_income`: Median household income in US dollars\n-   `household_has_computer`: Percent of households that have desktop or laptop computer\n\n[Click here](https://openintrostat.github.io/usdata/reference/county_2019.html) for the full codebook for the `county_2019` data set.\n\n# Exercises\n\nThere has been a lot of conversation recently about the impact of graduating college, i.e., obtaining a bachelor's degree, on one's future career and lifetime earnings. The common sentiment is that individuals who have earned a bachelor's degree (or higher) will earn more income over the course of a lifetime than an individual who does not have such a degree.\n\nThe culmination of individual factors can impact the wealth and resources of a county. Therefore will examine the association between these two factors at a county level and use the percent of adults 25 years old + with a Bachelor's degree to understand variability in the median income. Specifically we'd like to answer such as, \"do counties that have a higher percentage of college graduates have higher median household incomes, on average, compared to counties with a lower percentage of college graduates?\".\n\n::: callout-important\nAll narrative should be written in complete sentences, and all visualizations should have informative titles and axis labels.\n:::\n\n### Exercise 0\n\nLoad the `us-counties-sample.csv` into a data frame called `county_data_sample`.\n\n## Part 1: Exploratory data analysis\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nCreate a histogram of the distribution of the predictor variable `bachelors`and calculate appropriate summary statistics. Use the visualization and summary statistics to describe the distribution. Include an informative title and axis labels on the plot.\n\n### Exercise 2\n\nCreate a visualization of the relationship between `bachelors` and `median_household_income` and use the `cor` function to calculate the correlation. You will likely want to load the `mosaic` package. It is considered good form to load your packages at the beginning of the document so scroll up to the top and load `mosaic` there. Use the visualization and correlation to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\n::: callout-tip\nRecall the analysis objective stated at the beginning of the Exercises section.\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you haven't yet done so, now is a good time to render your document.\n:::\n\n## Part 2: Modeling\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nWe will use a linear regression model to better quantify the relationship between `bachelors` and `median_household_income`.\n\nWrite the form of the statistical model the researchers would like to estimate using the template below. Use mathematical notation (i.e. with Greek letters) and variable names (`bachelors` and `median_household_income`) in the equation. Note, I'm not asking you to fit the model yet. Replace each word in the equation below with either the name of a variable or a Greek letter.\n\n$$Response = intercept + slope\\times predictor + error$$\n\n::: callout-tip\n[Click here](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols) for a guide on writing mathematical symbols using LaTeX. You will need to use a backslash (\\\\) before each underscore in the LaTeX code. For example, `avg_air_temp` will be written as *avg\\\\\\_air\\\\\\_temp.*\n:::\n\n### Exercise 4\n\n-   Fit the regression line corresponding to the statistical model in the previous exercise. Use `tidy` and `kable` to neatly display the model output using 3 digits. Note you will need to load the `broom` package before you can use the `tidy` function.\n\n-   Write the equation of the fitted model using mathematical notation. Use variable names (`bachelors` and `median_household_income`) in the equation. Hint: Copy and paste your answer from the previous exercise, fill in the $\\beta$'s with numbers, and remove the error term.\n\n### Exercise 5\n\n-   Interpret the slope. The interpretation should be written in a way that is meaningful in the context of the data.\n-   Is it useful to interpret the intercept for this data? If so, write the interpretation in the context of the data. Otherwise, briefly explain why not.\n\n::: callout-tip\nNow is a good time to render your document again if you haven't done so recently.\n:::\n\n## Part 3: Inference for the U.S.\n\nWe want to use the data from these 600 randomly selected counties to draw conclusions about the relationship between the percent of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree and median household income for the over 3,000 counties in the United States.\n\n### Exercise 6\n\n-   What is the population of interest? What is the sample?\n\n-   Is it reasonable to treat the sample in this analysis as representative of the population? Briefly explain why or why not. If you have never taken a statistics course before, I encourage you to read subsections [2.1.4](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-design#sampling-from-a-population) and [2.1.5](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-design#sec-samp-methods) from [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/). Don't worry, they're very short.\n\n### Exercise 7\n\nConduct a hypothesis test for the slope to assess whether there is sufficient evidence of a linear relationship between the percent of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree and the median household income in a county. Use a randomization (permutation) test. Remember that you'll need to load the `infer` package. In your response:\n\n-   State the null and alternative hypotheses in words and mathematical notation\n-   Show all relevant code and output used to conduct the test. Use `set.seed(2025)` and 1000 iterations to construct the appropriate distribution.\n-   State the conclusion in the context of the data.\n\n### Exercise 8\n\nNext, construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope using bootstrapping with `set.seed(2025)` and 1000 iterations.\n\n-   Show all relevant code and output used to calculate the interval.\n\n-   Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the data.\n\n-   Is the confidence interval consistent with the results of the test from the previous exercise? Briefly explain why or why not.\n\n::: callout-tip\nNow is a good time to render your document again if you haven't done so recently.\n:::\n\n## Conceptual Questions\n\nPlease try to answer these concisely and adhere to the sentence maximum.\n\n### Exercise 9\n\nShould all of your classmates get the same 95% confidence interval as you? Max one sentence.\n\n### Exercise 10\n\nWhy was it necessary to set a seed in the previous two exercises and how does it relate to the concept of reproducibility? Max two sentences.\n\n### Exercise 11\n\nWould taking a larger sample of counties most likely result in a more or less precise confidence interval? What about a wider or narrower confidence interval? Max one sentence each but you should be able to answer with a single sentence.\n\n### Exercise 12\n\nWhy would taking a larger sample of counties not impact the accuracy of the 95% confidence interval? How can we increase the accuracy? Max two sentences.\n\n### Exercise 13\n\nExplain why the following statement doesn't make sense: \"There is a 95% probability that the population slope is between the two numbers I stated in Exercise 8. Max three sentences.\n\n## Reproducibility & Conceptual Questions\n\n### Exercise 14 (Extra Credit)\n\nYou are asked to use a reproducible workflow for all of your work in the class, and the goal of this question to is better understand potential real-world implications of doing (or not) doing so. [Here](https://mat212wi25.netlify.app/slides/01-welcome#/when-things-go-wrong) are some real-life examples in which having a non-reproducible workflow resulted in errors that impacted research and public records.\n\nChoose one of the scenarios from the table and read the linked article discussing what went wrong. Then,\n\n-   Briefly describe what went wrong, i.e., what part of the process was not reproducible and what error or impact that had.\n\n-   Then, describe how the researchers could make the process reproducible.\n\n::: callout-tip\nNow is a good time to render your document again.
