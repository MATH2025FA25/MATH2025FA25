To collect data, Hickey and collaborators at FiveThirtyEight set up an experiment people could vote on a series of randomly generated candy matchups (e.g. Reese's vs. Skittles). Click [here](http://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/) to check out some of the match ups.\n\nThe data set contains the characteristics and win percentage from 85 candies in the experiment. The variables are\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| `chocolate` | Does it contain chocolate? |\n| `fruity` | Is it fruit flavored? |\n| `caramel` | Is there caramel in the candy? |\n| `peanutyalmondy` | Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds? |\n| `nougat` | Does it contain nougat? |\n| `crispedricewafer` | Does it contain crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component? |\n| `hard` | Is it a hard candy? |\n| `bar` | Is it a candy bar? |\n| `pluribus` | Is it one of many candies in a bag or box? |\n| `sugarpercent` | The percentile of sugar it falls under within the data set. Values 0 - 1. |\n| `pricepercent` | The unit price percentile compared to the rest of the set. Values 0 - 1. |\n| `winpercent` | The overall win percentage according to 269,000 matchups. Values 0 - 100. |\n\nUse the code below to get a glimpse of the `candy_rankings` data frame in the **fivethirtyeight** R package.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(candy_rankings)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 85\nColumns: 13\n$ competitorname   <chr> \"100 Grand\", \"3 Musketeers\", \"One dime\", \"One quarter…\n$ chocolate        <lgl> TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, F…\n$ fruity           <lgl> FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE…\n$ caramel          <lgl> TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE,…\n$ peanutyalmondy   <lgl> FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, …\n$ nougat           <lgl> FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE,…\n$ crispedricewafer <lgl> TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE…\n$ hard             <lgl> FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALS…\n$ bar              <lgl> TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, F…\n$ pluribus         <lgl> FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE…\n$ sugarpercent     <dbl> 0.732, 0.604, 0.011, 0.011, 0.906, 0.465, 0.604, 0.31…\n$ pricepercent     <dbl> 0.860, 0.511, 0.116, 0.511, 0.511, 0.767, 0.767, 0.51…\n$ winpercent       <dbl> 66.97173, 67.60294, 32.26109, 46.11650, 52.34146, 50.…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Exercises\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to use multiple linear regression to understand the factors that make a good candy.\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nNotice that the values of `pricepercent` and `sugarpercent` are proportions. User `mutate` to change the scale so that they are percentages.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\n-   Our response variable in this homework will be `winpercentage`. Choose two additional variables, one quantitative and one categorical. Generate a SINGLE plot that visualizes all three variables. Hint: remember that you can tie any aesthetic in your plot (e.g. color) to a variable be writing `aesthetic = ~variable_name`. For example `color = ~variable1` will color the points based on `variable1`.\n-   Write two observations from your plot.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nFit a linear model including both variables you chose above.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nInterpret the following in the context of the data:\n\n-   Intercept\n\n-   Coefficient of your quantitative variable\n\n-   Coefficient(s) of your categorical variables\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nChoose one of the coefficients from your model and write out all the steps in the hypothesis test that corresponds to it's p-value as in [this slide](https://mat212wi25.netlify.app/slides/08-mlr-inference#/mlr-hypothesis-test-avgtemp).\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nInterpret the other p-values in your model in the context of the data. You do not need to write out the full hypothesis testing framework as you did in Exercise 5.\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nGenerate 95% confidence intervals for all of the slopes in your model and interpret them in the context of the data.\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nNow fit a model using the same explanatory variables, but include an interaction term. Interpret the coefficient of your interaction term in the context of the data.\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nInterpret the p-value associated with the interaction term.\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nBased on the results from exercise 9, would you choose the model with or without the interaction term?\n\n## Grading\n\nTotal points available: 15 points.\n\n| Component             | Points |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Ex 1                  | 1      |\n| Ex 2                  | 2      |\n| Ex 3                  | 1      |\n| Ex 4                  | 1      |\n| Ex 5                  | 1      |\n| Ex 6                  | 1      |\n| Ex 7                  | 2      |\n| Ex 8                  | 2      |\n| Ex 9                  | 1      |\n| Ex 10                 | 1      |\n| Grammar & Writing     | 1[^1]  |\n| Workflow & formatting | 1[^2]  |\n\n[^1]: The \"Grammar & Writing\" grade is decided based on your grammar and writing. This is typically decided by choosing one of the questions and assessing the writing.\n\n[^2]: The \"Workflow & formatting\" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow and document format. This includes having a neatly organized document with readable code and your name and the date in the YAML.\n",
