-   Open [RStudio](https://rstudio.collegeofidaho.edu/) and create a subfolder in your AE folder called "AE-06".

-   Go to the [Canvas](https://cofi.instructure.com/courses/17093/assignments/202836) and locate your `AE 06` assignment to get started.

-   Upload the `ae-06.qmd` files into the folder you just created. The `.qmd` and HTML responses are due in Canvas. You can check the due date on the Canvas assignment.

## Data

The data set for this assignment contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle, from homes
sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It was originally Obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/data). Our goal will be to try and predict the sale price of a house from the houses square footage.

## Variables

- Outcome
  + `price`: the sale price in dollars
- Predictor 
  + `sqft_living`: the square footage of the home
  
## Exercise 0

The dataset that we'll be using today is called `house_prices` and is contained in the `moderndive` package. Load the `moderndive` package.

## Exercise 1

Generate a scatter plot of the data. If you finish before other groups, visualize what a linear model would look like if fitted to this data. Based on what you see, do you think the conditions required of linear regression will be met?

## Exercise 2

Generate a scatter plot of the data but take the `log` of `price`. You can do this by putting `log(price) ~ sqft_living` instead of `price ~ sqft_living` in your call to `gf_point`. Do you think the data is ready for a linear regression model?

## Exercise 3

Generate a scatter plot of the data but take the `log` of `price` and a power transformation of `sqrt_living`. You can do this by putting `log(price) ~ sqft_living^(power)` instead of `price ~ sqft_living` in your call to `gf_point`. Once you're done, your data should be ready for modeling.

## Exercise 4

Fit the model above by using the `lm` function. Output the coefficients of your model. Can do this by using the formula (the thing with the `~`), just put `I()` around any power. For example `I(sqrt_living^(1/2))` instead of `sqrt_living^(1/2)`.

## Exercise 5 (Difficult)

Write your final model in the board in two ways. One with $\log(Y)$ and one with $Y$ is on the right side of the equal sign. You will want to use the properties of logs.

## Exercise 6 (Time Permitting)

Analyze the residuals for the model you created model.
