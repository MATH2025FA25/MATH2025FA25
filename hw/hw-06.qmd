## Introduction

In today's homework you will analyze data about candy that was collected from an online experiment conducted at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/).

### Learning goals

By the end of the homework you will be able to

-   Fit a linear model with multiple predictors and an interaction term
-   Fit a linear model with categorical predictors
-   Conduct inference on multiple linear models

## Getting started

-   Go to [RStudio](https://rstudio.collegeofidaho.edu) and login with your College of Idaho Email and Password.

-   Make a subfolder in your `hw` directory to store this homework.

-   Log into [Canvas](https://cofi.instructure.com/courses/17093/assignments/202864), navigate to Homework 6 and upload the `hw-06.qmd` file into the folder your just made.

## Data: Candy

The data from this lab comes from the the article FiveThirtyEight [*The Ultimate Halloween Candy Power Ranking*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking) by Walt Hickey. To collect data, Hickey and collaborators at FiveThirtyEight set up an experiment people could vote on a series of randomly generated candy matchups (e.g. Reese's vs. Skittles). Click [here](http://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/) to check out some of the match ups.

The data set contains the characteristics and win percentage from 85 candies in the experiment. The variables are

| Variable | Description |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `chocolate` | Does it contain chocolate? |
| `fruity` | Is it fruit flavored? |
| `caramel` | Is there caramel in the candy? |
| `peanutyalmondy` | Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds? |
| `nougat` | Does it contain nougat? |
| `crispedricewafer` | Does it contain crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component? |
| `hard` | Is it a hard candy? |
| `bar` | Is it a candy bar? |
| `pluribus` | Is it one of many candies in a bag or box? |
| `sugarpercent` | The percentile of sugar it falls under within the data set. Values 0 - 1. |
| `pricepercent` | The unit price percentile compared to the rest of the set. Values 0 - 1. |
| `winpercent` | The overall win percentage according to 269,000 matchups. Values 0 - 100. |

Use the code below to get a glimpse of the `candy_rankings` data frame in the **fivethirtyeight** R package.

## Exercises

The goal of this analysis is to use multiple linear regression to understand the factors that make a good candy.

## Exercise 1

Notice that the values of `pricepercent` and `sugarpercent` are proportions. User `mutate` to change the scale so that they are percentages.

## Exercise 2

-   Our response variable in this homework will be `winpercentage`. Choose two additional variables, one quantitative and one categorical. Generate a SINGLE plot that visualizes all three variables. Hint: remember that you can tie any aesthetic in your plot (e.g. color) to a variable be writing `aesthetic = ~variable_name`. For example `color = ~variable1` will color the points based on `variable1`.
-   Write two observations from your plot.

## Exercise 3

Fit a linear model including both variables you chose above.

## Exercise 4

Interpret the following in the context of the data:

-   Intercept

-   Coefficient of your quantitative variable

-   Coefficient(s) of your categorical variables

## Exercise 5

Choose one of the coefficients from your model and write out all the steps in the hypothesis test that corresponds to it's p-value as in [this slide](https://mat212wi25.netlify.app/slides/08-mlr-inference#/mlr-hypothesis-test-avgtemp).

## Exercise 6

Interpret the other p-values in your model in the context of the data. You do not need to write out the full hypothesis testing framework as you did in Exercise 5.

## Exercise 7

Generate 95% confidence intervals for all of the slopes in your model and interpret them in the context of the data.

## Exercise 8

Now fit a model using the same explanatory variables, but include an interaction term. Interpret the coefficient of your interaction term in the context of the data.

## Exercise 9

Interpret the p-value associated with the interaction term.

## Exercise 10

Based on the results from exercise 9, would you choose the model with or without the interaction term?

| Grammar & Writing     | 1[^1]  |
| Workflow & formatting | 1[^2]  |

[^1]: The "Grammar & Writing" grade is decided based on your grammar and writing. This is typically decided by choosing one of the questions and assessing the writing.

[^2]: The "Workflow & formatting" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow and document format. This includes having a neatly organized document with readable code and your name and the date in the YAML.
