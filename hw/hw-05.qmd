In this homework, you'll use simple and multiple linear regression to analyze the relationship between the number of doctors in a county, the number of beds, and the number of hospitals.

# Learning goals

By the end of the homework you will be able to...

-   compare models using $R^2$ and RMSE
-   transform observations to improve model fit
-   talk about outliers
-   fit a model with two predictors

## Data: County Health

The data set for this homework is from the `Stat2Data` R package which is the companion package for this course's textbook. It is the same data set that we used in AE-08. The data was originally generated by the American Medical Association and concerns the availability of health care in counties in the United States. You can find information [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Stat2Data/Stat2Data.pdf) by searching for the County Health Resources dataset.

```

It is relatively easy to count the number of hospitals a county has, whereas counting the number of doctors is much more difficult. We'd like to build a linear model to predict the number of doctors, contained in the variable `MDs`, from the number of hospitals, `Hospitals` and the number of beds, `Beds`.

## Exercise 1

Describe was an observational unit represents for this data set. How many are there?

## Exercise 2

In Example 1.7 of Stat2, they consider a simple linear model to predict the number of doctors (`MDs`) from the number of hospitals (`Hospitals`) in a metropolitan area. In that example, they found that a square root transformation on the response variable produced a more linear relationship. Create a new variable in the `CountyHealth` data frame called `sqrtMDs`. Hint: use the `sqrt` function inside the `mutate` function.

## Exercise 3

Use the function `ggpairs` from the package ``GGally`` to generate a grid scatter plots and correlations. Note that you will need to select the variables you want to use. Which explanatory variable (`Hospitals` or `Beds`) has the highest correlation with `SqrtMDs`?  Is this consistent with your visual assessment?


## Exercise 4

Fit a simple linear model using `SqrtMDs` as the response variable and `Hospitals` as the predictor. You may use `sqrt(MDs)` in your `lm` call instead of `SqrtMDs` if you like. How much of the variability in the `SqrtMDs` values is explained by `Hospitals`? How much of the variability in `MDs` is explained by the model you just fit. To figure this out:

1. Augment your model.
2. Convert the fitted and observed response variables back to number of MDs rather than square-root of the number of MDs.
3. Compute the $R^2$.

Why are these two numbers different?

## Exercise 5

Do you think taking the square root of `Beds` would improve this model? Support your argument with plots and/or numbers.

## Exercise 6

Repeat exercise 4 above with `Beds` as the predictor instead of `Hospitals`.

## Exercise 7

For the model you just fit, are there any high-influence outliers? Justify your answer using something from the lecture on outliers. There appear to be at least two high-leverage points. Which observations are these?

## Exercise 8

Fit a multiple linear model using `SqrtMDs` are the response variable and both `Hospitals` and `Beds` as the predictors. Interpret both slopes and the intercept in the context of the problem.

## Exercise 9

How much of the variation in `MDs` is explained by the model you just fit? Which model would you say is the "best", given what we've learned through the first lecture on multiple linear regression.

## Exercise 10

Using the "best" model, predict the average number of doctors in a metro area with 1,000 beds and 4 hospitals. Report a 95% prediction interval and interpret your results in context.
