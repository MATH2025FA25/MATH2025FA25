## Data: Restaurant tips

Which variables help us predict the amount customers tip at a restaurant?

## Variables

**Predictors**:

::: nonincremental

:::

**Outcome**: `Tip`: Amount of tip

## Outcome: `Tip`

## ANOVA {.smaller}

-   **Main Idea:** Decompose the total variation of the outcome into:
    -   the variation that can be explained by the each of the variables in the model
    -   the variation that **can't** be explained by the model (left in the residuals)
-   $SS_{Total}$: Total sum of squares, variability of outcome, $\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2$
-   $SS_{Error}$: Residual sum of squares, variability of residuals, $\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$
-   $SS_{Model} = SS_{Total} - SS_{Error}$: Variability explained by the model, $\sum_{i = 1}^n (\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2$

**Hypotheses:** 

$H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \cdots = \beta_k = 0$ vs. $H_A:$ at least one $\beta_i \neq 0$ 

. . .

    -   **Model 2:** $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \epsilon$
    -   **Model 3:** $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \beta_3X_1X_2 + \epsilon$
  
. . .

-   **Model 2** is nested inside both **Model 1** and **Model 3**. 
-   Why isn't **Model 3** nested in **Model 1**?
-   Smaller model is called the **Reduced Model**

## Recall: ANOVA, F-Test {.smaller}

**Hypotheses:** 

$H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \cdots = \beta_p = 0$ vs. $H_A:$ at least one $\beta_i \neq 0$ 

**Test statistic:** F-statistic

$$
F = \frac{MSModel}{MSE} = \frac{SSModel/p}{SSE/(n-p-1)} \\
$$

**p-value:** Probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme (in the direction of the alternative hypothesis) from the null value as the one observed

$$
\text{p-value} = P(F > \text{test statistic}),
$$

calculated from an $F$ distribution with $p$ and $n - p - 1$ degrees of freedom.

## Nested F-Test {.smaller}

Suppose $k$ is the number of $\beta$'s in the nested model and $p$ is the full number of predictors in the larger model. I.e. $\beta_{k+1},\ldots, \beta_{p}$ are the new $\beta$'s

**Hypotheses:** 

$H_0: \beta_{k+1} = \beta_{k+2} = \cdots = \beta_p = 0$ vs. $H_A:$ at least one $\beta_i \neq 0$ for $i>k+1$ 

**Test statistic:** F-statistic

$$
F = \frac{(SSModel_{full} - SSModel_{reduced})/(p-k)}{SSE_{full}/(n-p-1)} \\
$$

**p-value:** Probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme (in the direction of the alternative hypothesis) from the null value as the one observed

$$
\text{p-value} = P(F > \text{test statistic}),
$$

calculated from an $F$ distribution with $p-k$ (the number of predictors being tested) and $n - p - 1$ degrees of freedom.

. . .

Note: Same as regular F-test if reduced model is just $Y= \beta_0$.

anova(tip_fit_1, tip_fit_2) |> # Enter reduced model first
  tidy() |> 
  kable()
```

$$
F = \frac{(SSModel_{full} - SSModel_{reduced})/(p-k)}{SSE_{full}/(n-p-1)}
= \frac{15.59778/5}{6073815/158}
= 0.8114993

# Model comparison

## R-squared, $R^2$

**Recall**: $R^2$ is the proportion of the variation in the response variable explained by the regression model.

. . .

$$
R^2 = \frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \frac{SS_{Error}}{SS_{Total}}
$$

Complete Exercises 9-11.

## R-squared, $R^2$, Overfitting

-   $R^2$ will always increase as we add more variables to the model 
    +   If we add enough variables, we can usually achieve $R^2=100\%$
    +   Eventually our model will over-align to the noise in our data and become worse at predicting new data... this is called [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting#/media/File:Pyplot_overfitting.png)   
-   If we only use $R^2$ to choose a best fit model, we will be prone to choosing the model with the most predictor variables

## Adjusted $R^2$

-   **Adjusted** $R^2$: measure that includes a penalty for unnecessary predictor variables
-   Similar to $R^2$, it is a measure of the amount of variation in the response that is explained by the regression model
-   Differs from $R^2$ by using the mean squares (sum of squares/degrees of freedom) rather than sums of squares and therefore adjusting for the number of predictor variables

## $R^2$ and Adjusted $R^2$

$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \frac{SS_{Error}}{SS_{Total}}$$

<br>

. . .

$$R^2_{adj} = 1 - \frac{SS_{Error}/(n-p-1)}{SS_{Total}/(n-1)}$$

where

-   $n$ is the number of observations used to fit the model

-   $p$ is the number of terms (not including the intercept) in the model

## Using $R^2$ and Adjusted $R^2$

-   $R^2_{adj}$ can be used as a quick assessment to compare the fit of multiple models; however, it should not be the only assessment!
-   Use $R^2$ when describing the relationship between the response and predictor variables

## AIC & BIC

Estimators of prediction error and *relative* quality of models:

. . .

**Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)**: $$AIC = n\log(SS_\text{Error}) - n \log(n) + 2(p+1)$$ <br>

. . .

**Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**: $$BIC = n\log(SS_\text{Error}) - n\log(n) + log(n)\times(p+1)$$


## AIC & BIC

$$
\begin{aligned} 
& AIC = \color{blue}{n\log(SS_\text{Error})} - n \log(n) + 2(p+1) \\
& BIC = \color{blue}{n\log(SS_\text{Error})} - n\log(n) + \log(n)\times(p+1)

\end{aligned}
$$

Second Term: Fixed for a given sample size *n*

## AIC & BIC

$$
\begin{aligned} & AIC = n\log(SS_\text{Error}) - n\log(n) + \color{blue}{2(p+1)} \\
& BIC = n\log(SS_\text{Error}) - n\log(n) + \color{blue}{\log(n)\times(p+1)} 
\end{aligned}
$$

<br>

Third Term: Increases as *p* increases

## Using AIC & BIC

$$
\begin{aligned} & AIC = n\log(SS_{Error}) - n \log(n) + \color{red}{2(p+1)} \\
& BIC = n\log(SS_{Error}) - n\log(n) + \color{red}{\log(n)\times(p+1)} 
\end{aligned}
$$

-   Choose model with the smaller value of AIC or BIC

-   If $n \geq 8$, the **penalty** for BIC is larger than that of AIC, so BIC tends to favor *more parsimonious* models (i.e. models with fewer terms)

::: question
1.  Which model would we choose based on AIC?

2.  Which model would we choose based on BIC?
:::

## Commonalities between criteria

-   $R^2_{adj}$, AIC, and BIC all apply a penalty for more predictors
-   The penalty for added model complexity attempts to strike a balance between underfitting (too few predictors in the model) and overfitting (too many predictors in the model)
-   Goal: **Parsimony**

## Parsimony and Occam's razor {.small}

-   The principle of **parsimony** is attributed to William of Occam (early 14th-century English nominalist philosopher), who insisted that, given a set of equally good explanations for a given phenomenon, *the correct explanation is the simplest explanation*[^2]

-   Called **Occam's razor** because he "shaved" his explanations down to the bare minimum

-   Parsimony in modeling:

    ::: nonincremental
    -   models should have as few parameters as possible
    -   linear models should be preferred to non-linear models
    -   experiments relying on few assumptions should be preferred to those relying on many
    -   models should be pared down until they are *minimal adequate* (i.e. contain the minimum number of predictors required to meet some critereon)
    -   simple explanations should be preferred to complex explanations
    :::

[^2]: Source: The R Book by Michael J. Crawley.

## In pursuit of Occam's razor

-   Occam's razor states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected

-   Model selection follows this principle

-   We only want to add another variable to the model if the addition of that variable brings something valuable in terms of predictive power to the model

-   In other words, we prefer the simplest best model, i.e. **parsimonious** model

## Alternate views {.midi}

> Sometimes a simple model will outperform a more complex model . . . Nevertheless, I believe that deliberately limiting the complexity of the model is not fruitful when the problem is evidently complex. Instead, if a simple model is found that outperforms some particular complex model, the appropriate response is to define a different complex model that captures whatever aspect of the problem led to the simple model performing well.

## Other concerns with our approach {.midi}

-   All criteria we considered for model comparison require making predictions for our data and then uses the prediction error ($SS_{Error}$) somewhere in the formula
-   But we're making prediction for the data we used to build the model (estimate the coefficients), which can lead to **overfitting**



# Model Selection

## Model Selection

-   So far: We've come up with a variety of metrics and tests which help us compare different models
-   How do we choose the models to compare in the first place?
-   Today: Best subset, forward selection, and backward selection

## AIC, BIC, Mallows' $C_p$ {.smaller}

Estimators of prediction error and *relative* quality of models:

**Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)**: $$AIC = n\log(SS_\text{Error}) - n \log(n) + 2(p+1)$$ <br>

**Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**: $$BIC = n\log(SS_\text{Error}) - n\log(n) + log(n)\times(p+1)$$

. . .

**Mallows' $C_p$**: $$C_p = \frac{SSE_{p}}{MSE_{full model}} - n + 2(p+1)$$

## Best Subset Selection

-   Computers are great now!
-   Frequently feasible to try out EVERY combination of predictors if you total number of possible predictors is not too high.

## Best Subset Selection in R {.smaller}

```{r}
library(olsrr)

full_model <- lm(Tip ~ ., data = tips)

ols_step_best_subset(full_model)
```

Shows you "best" model for every model size.

## Backward Elimination {.smaller}

Different model selection technique:

1. Start by fitting the full model (the model that includes all terms under consideration).
2. Identify the term with the largest p-value.
    a. If p-value is large (say, greater than 5%), eliminate that term to produce a smaller model. Fit that model and return to the start of Step 2.
    b. If p-value is small (less than 5%), stop since all of the predictors in the model are "significant."

Note: this can be altered to work with other criterea (e.g. AIC) instead of p-values. This is actually what `regsubsets` does.


## Forward Selection {.smaller}

1. Start with a model with no predictors and find the best single predictor (the largest correlation with the response gives the biggest initial).
2. Add the new predictor to the model, run the regression, and find its individual p-value:
    a. If p-value is small (say, less than 5%), add predictor which would produce the most benefit (biggest increase in $R^2$) when added to the existing model.
    b. If the p-value is large (over 5%), stop and discard this predictor. At this point, no (unused) predictor should be significant when added to the model and we are done.

## Stepwise Selection {.smaller}

Forward, stepwise selection

1. Start with a model with no predictors and find the best single predictor (the largest correlation with the response gives the biggest initial).
2. Add the new predictor to the model, run the regression, and find its individual p-value:
    a. If p-value is small (say, less than 5%), **run backward elimination**, then add predictor which would produce the most benefit (biggest increase in $R^2$) when added to the existing model.
    b. If the p-value is large (over 5%), stop and discard this predictor. At this point, no (unused) predictor should be significant when added to the model and we are done.
    
- Why? Sometimes variables that were significant early on, can become insignificant after other new variables are added to the model.

Backward, stepwise selection is the same, except you perform forward selection every time you delete a term from the model.

## CAUTION {.smaller}

-   These automated methods have fallen out of favor in recent years, but you can still use them and should know what they are.
-   Automated methods ARE NOT a replacement for subject matter expertise
-   Think of the models that come out of these procedures as *suggestions*
-   The order in which variables are added to a model can *help* us understand which variables are more important and which are redundant.
