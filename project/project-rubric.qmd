| Applied Stats Individual Project Evaluation | Possible | Score |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|-------|
| **Data import and data cleaning – 5 pts** | | |
| Data is imported appropriately | 1 | |
| Missing values are dealt with appropriately and intentionally | 1 | |
| Categorical variables are recoded as factors | 1 | |
| The initial and final number of observations in the analysis reported and are those that were removed accounted for. | 1 | |
| Data preparation and cleaning procedures are clearly described so that the study could be replicated by another researcher. | 1 | |
| **Modeling – 20 pts** | | |
| Thoughtful variable selection employed to decide upon the final model. The the final model was compared with simpler options, and the form of the final model was justified. | 5 | |
| The conditions of the model were checked. | 5 | |
| If necessary, data transformations were explored. | 5 | |
| Interaction were explored and were included in the model when appropriat. | 5 | |
| **Results – 15 pts** | | |
| Final model is reported with parameter estimates, standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals. | 5 | |
| Parameter estimates and CIs werecorrectly interpreted in the context of the research question. | 5 | |
| Implications of the results are discussed in the context of the research question. | 2 | |
|Aa thoughtful discussion of generalizability of the results and limitations of the study are identified. | 1 | |
|Strengths and weaknesses of the analysis are identified, including a discussion of model conditions. | 2 | |
